# Next Steps
## 1: Match Generation
### FAB
- [x] Create Draft should have two options: Auto & manual - both should be available when all courts are in use so that the user can pre-organise the next game.


## 2: Active Session
### Session Stats
- [x] Currently we show In Progress, Completed, On Bench & Total play time. Lets change Total Play time to "Average Match Duration" and "On Bench" to "Average Games Per Player"

### Player Statistics
- [x] We should make the table as compact as possible to ensure it renders well on a mobile. Currently it needs to be scrolled & it is. Lets remove the skill avatar, make it sortable by the header, remove the status badge with an emoji instead to save space.

## 3: Settings Cog
### Settings
- [x] We should add a simple dialogue with settings. For now we will only have 2 settings available: theme (Dark mode, light mode, system) and an option to full wipe the database (start from scratch).
