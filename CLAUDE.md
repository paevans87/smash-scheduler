# Project Protocol: Agentic Dev Lab

## Core Constraints
- **Language**: English
- **Spelling**: Use English (UK) exclusively (e.g., 'optimise', 'colour', 'centre').
- **Comments**: NEVER include comments in generated code. Code must be self-documenting and apply SOLID principals.
- **Verification**: Always run tests after any code change and ensure new code & edge cases are covered by tests.
- **Git Workflow**: ALWAYS commit and push changes when work is complete. Never leave uncommitted or unpushed changes.
